# Introduction

This course aims to provide tools to deal with exploring and treating transportation datasets using R programming, an open-source and widely used tool for data analytics in urban mobility.

Additionally, this course provides guidance towards the use of reproducible methods to deal with large datasets that require manipulation and/or spatial analysis.

The course has a **hands-on** approach, where participants will learn the basics of **coding**, **data manipulation**, and **spatial analysis** for urban mobility and transportation.

## Mobility data

There is an emerging increase in mobility data, through new forms of technology, which result in very large and diverse datasets.

Knowing how to get, treat and analyze complex datasets with the up-to-date technologies is extremely relevant for academia, policy makers and start-ups, since it allows them to:

1.  acquire critical view on urban mobility based on data;

2.  spatially identify locations in the city that require policy priorities;

3.  and improve the efficiency of data analysis processes.

### Why R and GIS {.unnumbered}

Most academic programs focus on teaching modelling and deep analysis of data.
However, there is a need to learn how to explore and prepare a dataset for modelling.
The use of **programming and GIS** techniques have enormous advantages, including their flexibility; reproducibility; and transparency and understanding the step-by-step process.

The use of GIS techniques in transportation is, traditionally, not considered in transportation learning programs, despite being of enormous relevance when doing accessibility analysis or reeling with georreferenced transportation data, such as bike sharing route trips’ datasets, origin-destination flows datasets, home/work locations, GTFS public transit data, and so on.
There is a need to learn how to locate these open datasets, how to explore them and how to integrate them into transportation and urban analysis.
Additionally, the use of open source software and datasets allows researchers to perform methods that are reproducible and transparent.
