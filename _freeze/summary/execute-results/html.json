QGIS supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports viewing, editing, printing, and analysis of geospatial data in a range of data formats[^summary-1].\n\n[^summary-1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS>\n\nIn this course QGIS will be used to geocode coordinates, make accessibility analysis using the street network, and visualize OD flows.\n\nQGIS allows the visualization of data with a graphical user interface (GUI), which can be preferable for basic usage. For advanced computation with geo data, programming software such as Python or R can be more adequate.\n\n### Download\n\nYou should go for the Long-Term Version provided by QGIS. If you have installed the most up-to-date version, that's also fine.\n\n<https://qgis.org/download/>\n\n#### Windows\n\n#### Mac\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\n### Plugins\n",
