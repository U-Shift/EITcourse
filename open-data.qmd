# Open transportation data

In this chapter we will guide you through sources of open data for transportation analysis: road networks and public transportation information.

## Road Networks

### OpenStreetMap

The OpenStreetMap is a collaborative online mapping project that creates a free editable map of the world.

This is the most used source of road network data for transportation analysis in academia, since it is available almost **everywhere in the world**, is open and free to use.

Although it can be not 100% accurate, OSM is a good source of data for most of the cases.
:::

You can access it's visualization tool at [www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
To edit the map, you can use the [Editor](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit), once you register.

If you want to **download** the data, you can use the following tools.

-   [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API)
-   [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/)

These websites include all the OSM data, with **much more information than you need**.

### HOT Export Tool

This interactive tool helps you to select the **region** you want to extract, the type of **information** to include, and the output data **format**.

Access via [export.hotosm.org](https://export.hotosm.org/).
You need an OSM account to use it.

After the export, you can read in R using the `sf` package:

```{r}
#| fig-format: png
Gent = sf::st_read("data/Gent_center.gpkg", quiet = TRUE)

mapview::mapview(Gent, zcol = "highway")
```

### OSM in R

There are also some R packages that can help you to download and work with OpenStreetMap data, such as:

-   [`osmdata`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/index.html)
-   [`osmextract`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract)

This is an example of how to download OpenStreetMap road network data using the `osmextract` package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(osmextract)
OSM_Malta = oe_get_network(place = "Malta") # it will geocode the place

Malta_main_roads = OSM_Malta |> 
  filter(highway %in% c("primary", "secondary", "tertiary", "trunk"))

plot(Malta_main_roads["highway"])
```

## Transportation Services' Data

### GTFS

<!-- TO-DO -->

### National Access Points

The European Union has a directive that requires the member states to provide access to transportation data.
Data includes not only **Public Transportation** data, but also **road network**s, car **parking**, and other transportation-related information.

[List of the European Union members states with National Access Points for Transportation data](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/smart-mobility/road/its-directive-and-action-plan/national-access-points_en)

Example of Bus services data in Belgium:
