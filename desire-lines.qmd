# OD pairs and desire lines

Desire lines are a way to represent the flow of people or goods between two points.
They are often used in transport planning to represent the flow of trips between zones.

There are many ways to create desire lines, connecting origins and destinations.
For instance:

-   1 origin to 1 destination

    -   home ⟷ work place

-   multiple origins to a single destinations

    -   students’ homes ⟷ 1 school

-   origin zone to destination zone

    -   for aggregated trips (macro representation)

-   OD jittering[^desire-lines-1]

[^desire-lines-1]: See [@Lovelace2022].

The [`stplanr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/index.html) package is a collection of functions for sustainable transport planning with R, and it is built on top of the `sf` package [@stplanr].

In this workshop, we will use the [`od`](https://itsleeds.github.io/od/) package, a lightweight package with a few functions from `stplanr`, namely the ones to create desire lines from origin-destination (OD) pairs [@od].

## Desire lines with `od_to_sf`

To create desire lines, we need a dataset with OD pairs **and** other dataset with the corresponding transport zones (spatial data).

The `TRIPSmode.Rds` dataset includes origins, destinations and number of trips between municipalities.

```{r}
#| message: false
TRIPSmode = readRDS("data/TRIPSmode.Rds")
```

The `Municipalities_geo.gpkg` dataset includes the geometry of the transport zones.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(sf)
Municipalities_geo = st_read("data/Municipalities_geo.gpkg", quiet = TRUE) # supress mesage
```

Then, we need to load the `od` package.
We will use the `od_to_sf()` function to create desire lines from OD pairs.

```{r}
#| message: false
# install.packages("od")
library(od)

TRIPSdlines = od_to_sf(TRIPSmode, z = Municipalities_geo) # z for zones
```

For this magic to work smoothly, the first two columns of the `TRIPSmode` dataset must be the **origin** and **destination** zones, and these zones need to correspond to the first column of the `Municipalities_geo` dataset (with an associated geometry).

Now we can visualize the desire lines using the `mapview` function.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-format: png
library(mapview)
mapview(TRIPSdlines, zcol = "Total")
```

As you can see, this is too much information to be able to understand the flows.

### Filtering desire lines

Filter **intrazonal** trips.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-format: png
library(dplyr)

TRIPSdlines_inter = TRIPSdlines |> 
  filter(Origin != Destination) |> # remove intrazonal trips
  filter(Total > 5000) # remove noise

mapview(TRIPSdlines_inter, zcol = "Total", lwd = 5)
```

Filter trips with origin or destination **not in** Lisbon.

```{r}
#| fig-format: png
TRIPSdl_noLX = TRIPSdlines_inter |> 
  filter(Origin != "Lisboa", Destination != "Lisboa")

mapview(TRIPSdl_noLX, zcol = "Total", lwd = 8) # larger line width
```

Try to replace the `Total` with other variables, such as `Car`, `PTransit`, and see the differences.

## Oneway desire lines

Note that the `od_to_sf()` function creates bidirectional desire lines.
This can be not the ideal for visualization / representation purposes, as you will have 2 lines overlaping.

The function [`od_oneway()`](https://itsleeds.github.io/od/reference/od_oneway.html) aggregates oneway lines to produce bidirectional flows.

By default, it returns the sum of each numeric column for each bidirectional origin-destination pair.

```{r}
nrow(TRIPSdlines)
TRIPSdlines_oneway = od_oneway(TRIPSdlines) |> 
  filter(o != d) # remove empty geometries
nrow(TRIPSdlines_oneway)
```

Note that for the last municipalities you have less combinations now.
Nevertheless, all the possible combinations are represented.

```{r}
head(TRIPSdlines_oneway[,c(1,2)]) # just the first 2 columns
tail(TRIPSdlines_oneway[,c(1,2)])
```

Example of visualization with Public Transit trips in both ways.

```{r}
#| fig-format: png
TRIPSdlines_oneway_noLX = TRIPSdlines_oneway |> 
  filter(PTransit > 5000) # reduce noise

mapview(TRIPSdlines_oneway_noLX, zcol = "PTransit", lwd = 8)
```

## Using population centroids

The `od_to_sf()` function uses the geometric center of the zones to create the desire lines.
But if we replace those zones by the [weighted centroids](spatial-data.qmd#weighted-centroids), we can have a more realistic representation of the flows.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| include: false
Centroid_pop = st_read("data/Centroid_pop.gpkg", quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
# Centroid_pop = st_read("data/Centroid_pop.gpkg")

TRIPSdlines_pop = od_to_sf(TRIPSmode, z = Centroid_pop) |>  # works the same way
  od_oneway() |> # oneway
  filter(o != d) # remove empty geometries
```

Check differences of lines with trips from/to Lisbon:

```{r}
#| fig-format: png
TRIPSdlines_geo_LX = TRIPSdlines_oneway |> 
  filter(o == "Lisboa" | d == "Lisboa") # or condition
TRIPSdlines_pop_LX = TRIPSdlines_pop |> 
  filter(o == "Lisboa" | d == "Lisboa")

mapview(TRIPSdlines_geo_LX, color = "blue") + mapview(TRIPSdlines_pop_LX, color = "red")
```

The next step will be estimating the **euclidean distances** between these centroids, and compare them with the **routing distances**.
