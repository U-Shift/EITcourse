# Software

In this chapter we will guide you through the installation of R and QGIS.

## R and RStudio

You will need **R** installed on your computer (version 4.4.1 or higher) and also **RStudio**[^software-1].

[^software-1]: We will use RStudio, although if you already use other studio such as VScode, that's also fine.

### R

### RStudio

## QGIS

QGIS is a geographic information system software that is free and open-source. QGIS supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports viewing, editing, printing, and analysis of geospatial data in a range of data formats[^software-2].

[^software-2]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS>

In this course QGIS will be used to geocode coordinates, make accessibility analysis using the street network, and visualize OD flows.

QGIS allows the visualization of data with a graphical user interface (GUI), which can be preferable for basic usage. For advanced computation with geo data, programming software such as Python or R can be more adequate.

### Download

You should go for the Long-Term Version provided by QGIS. If you have installed the most up-to-date version, that's also fine.

<https://qgis.org/download/>

This download will be about 1.2-1.6 GB.

You should also have Python installed. Otherwise QGIS will install it for you \[?\].

#### Windows

[Download](https://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.34.10-1.msi) and open the executable file.

#### Mac

[Download](https://qgis.org/downloads/macos/qgis-macos-ltr.dmg) and open the executable file.

#### Ubuntu

You can look for QGIS in the Ubuntu **Software Center** or install it via the terminal.

```{bash}
sudo apt install gnupg software-properties-common
sudo mkdir -m755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings  # not needed since apt version 2.4.0 like Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22 or newer
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg https://download.qgis.org/downloads/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add the QGIS repo for the latest stable QGIS (3.38.x Grenoble) to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources`:

```         
Types: deb deb-src
URIs: https://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr
Suites: jammy
Architectures: amd64
Components: main
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg
```

```{bash}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass saga
sudo apt install python3-qgis
```
:::

Consider change the language to English in the global options (easier to follow tutorials).

### Plugins

For this course we will use the Open Route Service plugin.

#### Basemaps

Install the useful free basemaps.

> Copy-past into the python console: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klakar/QGIS_resources/master/collections/Geosupportsystem/python/qgis_basemaps.py>

#### Open Route Service

[Sign up for an account](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup) and create a token. Copy your API.

> In QGIS Plugins → Manage and install plugins → Search for **ORS Tools** → Install Open ORS Tools, provider, settings, and paste API key.

#### qgis2web

This is an useful pluggin to create interactive HTML maps.

> In QGIS Plugins → Manage and install plugins → Search for **qgis2web** → Install qgis2web.
