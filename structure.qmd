# Course Structure

The course consists of an in-person 2-day course, taking place during the EIT DTN Annual Meeting on the **19th and 20th September 2024**.

The first day will focus on learning the basics of R programming and how to treat and explore datasets.
The second day will focus on analyzing spatial datasets, and routing origins to destinations.

## Day 1

### Morning {.unnumbered}

We will start by a brief introduction to this course, followed by an introduction to programming techniques and data structures.

Then, we will install R and RStudio, and and the required R packages for this course, as in [Software](software.qmd) section.

After having everything setup, we will start with the [R basics](r-basics.qmd), with examples and exercises.

### Afternoon {.unnumbered}

In the afternoon, we will focus on [data manipulation](data-manipulation.qmd), using the dplyr package to select, filter, left-join, group and summarize datasets.

Then, we will [introduce GIS and spatial data](spatial-data.qmd), learning how to importing and visualize vector data.

Finally, we will learn how to create cool [interactive maps](interactive-maps.qmd) using mapview and R markdown.

## Day 2

### Morning {.unnumbered}

We will start the day by estimating the different types of [centroids of transport zones](centroids.qmd).

After this, the natural next step is to create [desire lines](desire-lines.qmd) from orgins and destinations of the transport zones.

We will then learn how to estimate [euclidean and routing distances](distances.qmd) for the desire-lines, using transport networks.

### Afternoon {.unnumbered}

In the second afternoon, we will briefly learn where to find and extract [open transportation data](open-data.qmd), such as OpenStreetMap and GTFS.

Then, we will learn how to perform [accessibility analysis](r5r.qmd), using the r5r package.

And finally, to wrap up all this topics, we will have a group exercise using other complex datasets, where you will apply the knowledge learned during the course.
