# Course Structure

The course consists of an in-person 2-day course, taking place during the EIT DTN Annual Meeting on the **19th and 20th September 2024**.

The first day will focus on learning the basics of R programming and how to treat and explore datasets. The second day will focus on analyzing spatial datasets, and routing origins to destinations.

## Day 1

### Morning {.unnumbered}

-   Introduction to **programming** techniques and **data structures**

-   Introduction to R, and RStudio: **software installation** and main packages

-   **R base and basics**: examples and exercises

### Afternoon {.unnumbered}

-   **Data manipulation**: using the dplyr package to select, filter, left-join, group and summarize

-   Introduction to **GIS** and **spatial data**: import and visualize vector data

-   R markdown and **interactive maps**

## Day 2

### Morning {.unnumbered}

-   **Desire lines** from OD and transport zones

-   **Georeference** coordinates: examples from surveys

-   **Routing**: from euclidean distances to road networks

### Afternoon {.unnumbered}

-   **Open Transportation data**: where to find it

-   **Acessibility analysis with R**: *r5r demo* (Rafael Pereira)

-   Group **exercise**
