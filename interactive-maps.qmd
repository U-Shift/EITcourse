# Interactive maps

You can plot a static map using `plof(sf)`, but you can also create interactive maps.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
# data preparation
library(sf)
TRIPSgeo_mun = st_read("https://github.com/U-Shift/MQAT/raw/main/geo/TRIPSgeo_mun.gpkg")
TRIPSgeo = TRIPSgeo_mun |> 
  rename(Municipality = "Concelho") |> 
  st_set_geometry("geometry")
st_write(TRIPSgeo, "data/TRIPSgeo.gpkg", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
library(sf)
TRIPSgeo = st_read("data/TRIPSgeo.gpkg")

plot(TRIPSgeo)
```

Interactive maps are useful to explore the data, as you can zoom in and out, and click on the points to see the data associated with them.

There are several R packages to create interactive maps.
For instance, the `tmap` package, the `leaflet` package, and the `mapview` package.

## Mapview

Mapview allows to create quick interactive maps, only by declaring the function `mapview()`.

```{r}
library(mapview)
mapview(TRIPSgeo)
```

To color the points by a variable, you can use the `zcol` argument.

```{r}
mapview(TRIPSgeo, zcol = "Total")
```

As you can see, a color palette is automatically assigned to the **continuous variable**.

Try to use a **categorical variable**.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
mapview(TRIPSgeo, zcol = "Municipality")
```

Note that you can change the basemap, and click on the geometries to see the data associated with them.

You can go crazy with all the options that `mapview` offers.
Please refer to the [documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/articles/mapview_02-advanced.html) to see all the options.


### Export

You can export a map as an html file or image.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# install.packages("webshot2") # you will need this

map = mapview(TRIPSgeo, zcol = "Total") # fisrt create a objet with the desited map

mapshot2(map, "data/map.html") # as webpage
mapshot2(map, file = "data/map.png") # as image
```
> This is not the most straightforward solution.

## tmap

The `tmap` package is another package to create interactive maps.

To create a map, you need to declare a `tm_shape()` for the dataset you are using and a `tm_polygons()`.
(or lines or other) to declare the representation you want.

```{r}
#| message: false
# install.packages("tmap")
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view") # by default tmap_mode is "plot" - a static map

tm_shape(TRIPSgeo) + tm_polygons("Total")
```

### Export

With `tmap` you can directly export the map as an `html` file or image, using the Viewer panel.

## Rmarkdown

To include a map on a report, website, paper (any type), you can create an Rmarkdown file.

And include a R code chunk with a map.
If the output is html, you will get an interactive map on your document!
