    "text": "1.1 Mobility data\nThere is an emerging increase in mobility data, through new forms of technology, which result in very large and diverse datasets.\n\n\n\nE-Scooter trip data in Lisbon. How to deal with it?\n\n\nKnowing how to get, treat and analyze complex datasets with the up-to-date technologies is extremely relevant for academia, policy makers and start-ups, since it allows them to:\n\nacquire critical view on urban mobility based on data;\nspatially identify locations in the city that require policy priorities;\nand improve the efficiency of data analysis processes.\n\n\nWhy R and GIS\nMost academic programs focus on teaching modelling and deep analysis of data. However, there is a need to learn how to explore and prepare a dataset for modelling. The use of programming and GIS techniques have enormous advantages, including their flexibility; reproducibility; and transparency and understanding the step-by-step process.\nThe use of GIS techniques in transportation is, traditionally, not considered in transportation learning programs, despite being of enormous relevance when doing accessibility analysis or reeling with georreferenced transportation data, such as bike sharing route trips’ datasets, origin-destination flows datasets, home/work locations, GTFS public transit data, and so on. There is a need to learn how to locate these open datasets, how to explore them and how to integrate them into transportation and urban analysis. Additionally, the use of open source software and datasets allows researchers to perform methods that are reproducible and transparent.\n\nTLDR\n\nOpen-source tools widely used in data analytics and spatial analysis\nFlexibility and reproducibility in data manipulation and visualization\nCritical for urban mobility and transportation research, with spatial relevance\nLarge transportation datasets are becoming increasingly common"
