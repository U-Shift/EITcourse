## QGIS

QGIS is a geographic information system software that is free and open-source. QGIS supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports viewing, editing, printing, and analysis of geospatial data in a range of data formats[^summary-1].

[^summary-1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS>

In this course QGIS will be used to geocode coordinates, make accessibility analysis using the street network, and visualize OD flows.

QGIS allows the visualization of data with a graphical user interface (GUI), which can be preferable for basic usage. For advanced computation with geo data, programming software such as Python or R can be more adequate.

### Download

You should go for the Long-Term Version provided by QGIS. If you have installed the most up-to-date version, that's also fine.
