    "text": "1.1 Mobility data\nThere is an emerging increase in mobility data, through new forms of technology, which result in very large and diverse datasets.\n\n\n\nE-Scooter trip data in Lisbon. How to deal with it?\n\n\nKnowing how to get, treat and analyze complex datasets with the up-to-date technologies is extremely relevant for academia, policy makers and start-ups, since it allows them to:\n\nacquire critical view on urban mobility based on data;\nspatially identify locations in the city that require policy priorities;\nand improve the efficiency of data analysis processes.\n\n\nWhy R and GIS\nMost academic programs focus on teaching modelling and deep analysis of data. However, there is a need to learn how to explore and prepare a dataset for modelling. The use of programming and GIS techniques have enormous advantages, including their flexibility; reproducibility; and transparency and understanding the step-by-step process.\nThe use of GIS techniques in transportation is, traditionally, not considered in transportation learning programs, despite being of enormous relevance when doing accessibility analysis or reeling with georreferenced transportation data, such as bike sharing route trips’ datasets, origin-destination flows datasets, home/work locations, GTFS public transit data, and so on. There is a need to learn how to locate these open datasets, how to explore them and how to integrate them into transportation and urban analysis. Additionally, the use of open source software and datasets allows researchers to perform methods that are reproducible and transparent.\n\nTLDR\n\nOpen-source tools widely used in data analytics and spatial analysis\nFlexibility and reproducibility in data manipulation and visualization\nCritical for urban mobility and transportation research, with spatial relevance\nLarge transportation datasets are becoming increasingly common",

    "text": "3.2 QGIS\nQGIS is a geographic information system software that is free and open-source. QGIS supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports viewing, editing, printing, and analysis of geospatial data in a range of data formats2.\nIn this course QGIS will be used to geocode coordinates, make accessibility analysis using the street network, and visualize OD flows.\nQGIS allows the visualization of data with a graphical user interface (GUI), which can be preferable for basic usage. For advanced computation with geo data, programming software such as Python or R can be more adequate.\n\n3.2.1 Download\nYou should go for the Long-Term Version provided by QGIS. If you have installed the most up-to-date version, that’s also fine.\nhttps://qgis.org/download/\nThis download will be about 1.2-1.6 GB.\nYou should also have Python installed. Otherwise QGIS will install it for you [?].\n\nWindowsMacUbuntu\n\n\nDownload and open the executable file.\n\n\nDownload and open the executable file.\n\n\nYou can look for QGIS in the Ubuntu Software Center or install it via the terminal.\n\nsudo apt install gnupg software-properties-common\nsudo mkdir -m755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings  # not needed since apt version 2.4.0 like Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22 or newer\nsudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg https://download.qgis.org/downloads/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg\n\nAdd the QGIS repo for the latest stable QGIS (3.38.x Grenoble) to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources:\nTypes: deb deb-src\nURIs: https://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr\nSuites: jammy\nArchitectures: amd64\nComponents: main\nSigned-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg\n\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass saga\nsudo apt install python3-qgis\n\n\n\n\nConsider change the language to English in the global options (easier to follow tutorials).\n\n\n3.2.2 Plugins\nFor this course we will use the Open Route Service plugin.\n\nBasemaps\nInstall the useful free basemaps.\n\nCopy-past into the python console: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klakar/QGIS_resources/master/collections/Geosupportsystem/python/qgis_basemaps.py\n\n\n\nOpen Route Service\nSign up for an account and create a token.
