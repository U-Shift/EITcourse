# Introduction

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

## Why R and GIS

-   Open-source tools widely used in data analytics and spatial analysis

-   Flexibility and reproducibility in data manipulation and visualization

-   Critical for urban mobility and transportation research, with spatial relevance

-   Large transportation datasets are becoming increasingly common

## Course objectives

### Introduce R Programming Basics

-   Equip participants with foundational skills in R programming

-   Emphasize reproducible research practices to ensure transparency and replicability in analyses

### Teach Data Manipulation Techniques

-   Use key R packages for data cleaning, manipulation, and summarization of datasets

-   Enable participants to efficiently handle large and complex transportation datasets

### Spatial Data Visualization

-   Introduce methods for quick and effective spatial data visualization using R and GIS tools

-   Provide hands-on experience with creating interactive maps and visualizations

### Perform Basic Spatial Analysis

-   Teach participants how to perform spatial analysis of transportation datasets using GIS techniques with R

-   Cover practical applications such as georeferencing data, accessibility analysis, and routing ODs

-   Utilize real-world transportation data for practical, hands-on learning

## Target audience

-   Ph.D. candidates from DTN and other researchers

-   Policy makers and practitioners in urban mobility

-   Beginners to intermediate R users, no prior experience needed
